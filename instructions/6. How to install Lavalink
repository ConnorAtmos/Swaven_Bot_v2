Then follow this tutorial for installing Lavalink:

https://blog.darrennathanael.com/post/how-to-lavalink/

In the same directory as Lavalink, do this to get the settings file:

wget https://cdn.darrennathanael.com/jars/application.yml

After, you can have lavalink automatically start by modifying LavaLink.service for what you need, and then
copying it over to /etc/systemd/system/LavaLink.service.

Then, enable the service with the two commands:

sudo systemctl enable LavaLink.service
sudo systemctl restart LavaLink.service
